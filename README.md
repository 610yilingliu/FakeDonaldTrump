# Fake Donald Trump
Fake Trump's faces generated by GAN, study only

## Data Resource

From [Kaggle Trump Photo Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mbkinaci/trump-photos)

Trump's photos are also available by using [Python Google Image Downloading Tool](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download)

Tests could be found in another project also wrote by myself: [Generate House Number by Yiling](https://github.com/610yilingliu/GenerateHouseNumber), Some of the code in this project are also copied from Generate House Number.

Generate House Number(TensorFLow version) is a project that I created for students who studying AI in the University of Western Australia to study DCGAN with detailed comment about Python and computer vision.

## Achieved Result

Could be found in [Results](./results)

`avatar_trump` is not one of the result folder, it just something fun happened when I forgot to convert BGR to RGB, so the Trump looks like Avatar :)

## General Process

- Crop Trump's face from photos in mentioned data resources with OpenCV, dlib and face_recognition library(in [`get_face.py`](./pkg/get_face.py))
- Resize face into 64 * 64 images
- Convert those 64 * 64 image to an numpy dataset for further use
- Apply DCGAN, visualization and logging are applied during the training process and the images generated while training will be in './report_imgs' and the losses and model will be in `./logs` by default

## Applied techs
- DCGAN
- Dynamic learning rate

Will try to use relu + relu or leaky-relu + leaky-relu instead of relu+leaky relu in generator and discriminator, and use other GANs from papers instead of raw DCGAN

In "Generate House Number" project I tried to remove all relu layers from generator and found the result is not good.(relu can reduce the dimension of output by removing negative factors)

## Usage
I am using VSCode to debugging and running this project in my own machine(I am currently in China and Colab is not very stable to visit with my own AWS vpn).

You can use IDE to open this folder as a project, and run `__main__.py`.

You can also add prefix `pkg.` for all imports(not include library installed in the environment) under pkg folder and type `python -m pkg` to run.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- dlib
  
Scipy is not really needed, if you haven't installed Scipy and got an errorr in `get_npz.py`, fell free to remove `import scipy.io` and function `mat_tonpz`. That function aims to convert .mat file to .npz file, but we are using images here.
